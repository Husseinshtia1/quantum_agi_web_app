Quantum Stock Predictor
This project is a Quantum-Enhanced Stock Prediction Model using a hybrid approach of classical and quantum machine learning models. The project fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, and trains a quantum-classical model with a cross-attention mechanism to predict stock prices.

Overview
The Quantum Stock Predictor combines the power of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with classical neural networks to improve prediction accuracy for financial time-series data. The model utilizes tensorflow, pennylane (for quantum computing), and yfinance (for stock data) to implement a hybrid quantum-classical model. The primary goal of the project is to explore the benefits of quantum computing in stock price prediction.

Features
Quantum Circuit: A basic quantum circuit for quantum-enhanced feature processing.
Cross Attention Layer: Helps the model focus on relevant parts of input data, improving prediction accuracy.
Stock Data Fetching: Automatically downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Data Preprocessing: Normalizes and preprocesses the stock data for training.
Model Training: Combines classical and quantum models to predict stock prices based on historical data.
Evaluation & Cross-Validation: Provides both basic evaluation on a test set and k-fold cross-validation.
Model Saving and Loading: Allows saving and loading the trained model for later use.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or above
TensorFlow 2.17.0 or above
PennyLane (for quantum computing)
yFinance (for fetching stock data)
scikit-learn (for data splitting and cross-validation)
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Husseinshtia1/quantum-stock-predictor.git
cd quantum-stock-predictor
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt


python3 quantum_stock_predictor.py
Model Evaluation: The script will fetch stock data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance. You can modify the number of epochs, batch size, and other hyperparameters in the script as needed.


# Example usage in the quantum_stock_predictor.py script
predictor = QuantumStockPredictor(ticker='AAPL', start_date='2020-01-01', end_date='2021-01-01')
predictor.run()
Key Components
quantum_and_agi_code/qml_integration.py: Core logic for the quantum-classical model, stock data collection, and evaluation.
Cross Attention Layer: Helps the model focus on the most relevant parts of the data.
Quantum Circuit: A basic quantum machine learning circuit built using PennyLane.
Troubleshooting
Ensure that the correct Python interpreter is selected in your IDE if you face import errors.
Make sure tensorflow and pennylane are correctly installed.
