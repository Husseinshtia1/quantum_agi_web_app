Overview
The Quantum AGI Web App is an experimental platform that enables users to work with both quantum and classical AI models. Built for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts, this app simplifies the process of integrating quantum mechanics concepts with AGI development, offering tools for model building, simulation, and data-driven analysis.
Features
•	Quantum Circuit Simulation: Design and test quantum circuits with an intuitive interface.
•	AGI Model Training: Define, train, and test AGI models with adjustable parameters.
•	Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computation: Run computations that combine quantum algorithms with classical AI models.
•	Real-Time Analysis and Visualization: Visualize results from simulations and model computations instantly.
•	Modular and Customizable: Add your own modules or workflows to expand the app’s capabilities.
•	Quantum AI Toolkit: Access pre-built functions for quantum-inspired operations (e.g., entanglement, superposition).
